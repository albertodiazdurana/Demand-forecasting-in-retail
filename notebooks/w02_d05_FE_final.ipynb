    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook accomplishes the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load Day 4 output (w02_d04_FE_with-aggregations.pkl, 55 columns)\n",
    "- Analyze onpromotion feature (Week 1 finding: 74% lift)\n",
    "- Create promotion interaction features (onpromotion × aggregations)\n",
    "- Optional: Promotion density/frequency metrics\n",
    "- Finalize feature engineering for Week 2\n",
    "- Export final dataset for Week 3 modeling\n",

    "## Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why promotion features matter:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Promotions drive significant sales lift (Week 1: 74% when promoted):\n",
    "- **Interaction effects:** Promotion impact varies by store, cluster, item\n",
    "- **Timing patterns:** Holiday + promotion combinations\n",
    "- **Density metrics:** Frequency of promotions per store/item\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected patterns:**\n",
    "- High-volume items: Smaller promotion lift % (already selling well)\n",
    "- Low-volume items: Larger promotion lift % (promotion drives discovery)\n",
    "- Popular stores: More frequent promotions (inventory capacity)\n",
    "- Niche items: Rare promotions (targeted campaigns)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables:**\n",
    "- 2-3 promotion features\n",
    "- Final engineered dataset (28-30 total features)\n",
    "- Ready for Week 3 modeling\n",

    "From Week 2 Day 4:\n",
    "- Dataset: w02_d04_FE_with-aggregations.pkl (300,896 rows × 55 columns)\n",
    "- Contains: Base + 4 lags + 6 rolling + 6 oil + 11 aggregations\n",
    "- Date range: 2013-01-02 to 2017-08-15\n",

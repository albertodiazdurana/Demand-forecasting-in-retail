## Message to Send:

Hi! I've made some important changes to the MLflow configuration in the project. Here's what happened:

### Problem Solved
MLflow models weren't appearing in the UI because of mixed tracking directories (`mlruns/` vs `mlflow_results/`).

### Solution Implemented
I've centralized the MLflow configuration with these new files:

1. **`config/mlflow_config.py`** - Centralized configuration module
   ```python
   from config.mlflow_config import setup_mlflow
   setup_mlflow("experiment_name")
   ```

2. **`scripts/start_mlflow_ui.sh`** - Startup script for MLflow UI
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start_mlflow_ui.sh
   ```

3. **Documentation:**
   - `docs/mlflow/README.md` - Quick reference
   - `docs/mlflow/SETUP.md` - Full guide
   - `docs/mlflow/MIGRATION_EXAMPLES.md` - Migration examples
   - `docs/mlflow/CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - Complete summary of changes

### Key Changes

**Old pattern (inconsistent):**
```python
MLFLOW_DIR = PROJECT_ROOT / 'mlflow_results'
mlflow.set_tracking_uri(f"file://{MLFLOW_DIR}")
mlflow.set_experiment("my_experiment")
```

**New pattern (standardized):**
```python
from config.mlflow_config import setup_mlflow
setup_mlflow("my_experiment")
```

### Current State
- **Single tracking location:** `mlflow_results/`
- **Existing experiments preserved:** `full_pipeline_model_comparison` with XGBoost and LSTM runs
- **All notebooks should use:** `setup_mlflow()` going forward
- **Start UI with:** `./scripts/start_mlflow_ui.sh`

### Files to Review
Please check these files for full context:
- `docs/mlflow/CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - Complete technical summary
- `docs/mlflow/README.md` - Quick start guide
- `config/mlflow_config.py` - Implementation

All MLflow tracking is now unified in one location. No more "where did my models go?" issues! 🎉

## Alternative: Attach File

You can also just share the file `docs/mlflow/CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - it contains all the technical details, migration patterns, and current state of the MLflow setup.

## Quick Context Bullet Points

If you want to give even shorter context:

- ✅ Fixed: MLflow models not appearing in UI
- ✅ Created: Centralized config module (`config/mlflow_config.py`)
- ✅ Created: UI startup script (`scripts/start_mlflow_ui.sh`)
- ✅ Single tracking location: `mlflow_results/`
- ✅ All notebooks should use: `from config.mlflow_config import setup_mlflow`
- ✅ Documentation: `docs/mlflow/README.md`, `docs/mlflow/SETUP.md`
- ✅ Migration guide: `docs/mlflow/MIGRATION_EXAMPLES.md`
- ✅ Complete summary: `docs/mlflow/CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`

## What to Expect

When you mention these changes in the other chat:
1. Claude will understand the new MLflow structure
2. It can reference the documentation files
3. It will know to use `setup_mlflow()` in notebooks
4. It will know how to start the UI correctly
